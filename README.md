This repository contains my SQLAlchemy Challenge submission for Module 10 of the UCB Data Analytics Boot Camp.

## Notes

- The app.py file will run the climate app for Part 2 of the assignment. Please note that dates should be entered in the API call in the following format: DDMMYYY. (For example, a date of January 3, 2010 should be entered as 01032010.) 
- The Resources folder contains the necessary sqlite file as well as CSV files for both datasets (Measurements and Stations). 
- The archive folder contains my working files; they are included for reference only.
